We may change the price of Services at any time, without affecting your past purchases.  You shall be authorized to use the payment method that you provided and any payment information you provide shall be true and accurate.  When you provide a payment method, you authorize us to charge you for the Services using such payment method to charge you for any paid feature of the Services that you choose to sign up for.

    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.3 Cash Deposits. You are a “Cash Player” if you play in a competition that requires a cash entry fee to be paid (“Cash Competition”).  If you establish a positive Account balance for entry fees for Cash Competitions, then you are required to submit the information of your full name, permanent address, phone number, and credit card or other payment information, and to maintain such information current and correct at all times. We may require you to establish a positive Account balance in any amount we determine in order to participate in Cash Competitions.  If you are a Cash Player, you allow us to share your personal and payment information in confidence with third party service providers in order to validate your identity and assess the transaction risk associated with accepting your selected method of payment, as well as any other purpose as detailed in our Privacy Policy.  If you make a credit card deposit, we may require at least a US$10.00 credit limit by sending an authorization request to the issuing bank, no matter whether the actual amount charged is lower.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.4 Withdrawal Requests; Closing Accounts. If you are a “Cash Player,” you may request a withdrawal of funds from your available Account balance at any time. Subject to our confirmation of funds availability, withdrawal requests may take up to 15 days to process. We reserve the right to freeze a user’s Account and/or delay a request for withdrawal pending completion of any investigation of reported or suspected abuse by a user requesting withdrawal of funds. The minimum amount of any withdrawal (other than when your Account is closed) is US$10.00.   If your account is closed then, subject to our right to freeze a user’s Account, delay a request for withdrawal, or declare that funds are forfeited because of your Fraud, the remaining funds in your Account at the time of closing will be returned to you.  If you initiate a withdrawal of funds from your Account, you will forfeit all Bonus Cash currently in your Account.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.5 Service Fee. For any cash deposit added to your Account, your Account will be credited for the amount deposited net of service fees to cover the costs we need to pay for the transaction; the service fee for each deposit is equal to 15% of the amount deposited into your Account and will be charged when you submit a withdrawal application. The service fee, however, is waived when 50% of the amount of cash deposited into your Account has been used to pay entry fees of Games in Application.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.6 Refund Policy. We will not grant you any refunds, unless otherwise required by law. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.7 Winnings. When you receive Winnings, you may be required to provide us with proof evidencing that you are, or were at the time of your participation, eligible to participate in the subject competition in accordance with these Terms and that you did participate in accordance with these Terms.  If you fail to provide us with such proof to our reasonable satisfaction, you will not receive the relevant Winnings. We may reverse or require return of any payment in error which has been received by you and you shall cooperate with us in this regard. We may also reduce payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.8 Credit Card/PayPal Use. When you pay by credit card, you represent to us that you are the authorized user of such credit card. If your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address changes, or if your credit card expires or is cancelled for any reason, you must notify us immediately. We are not liable for any loss caused by any unauthorized use of your credit card or other method of payment by a third party (such as PayPal) in connection with the Services. Any attempt to defraud through the use of credit cards or other methods of payment, regardless of the outcome, or any failure by you to honor legitimate charges or requests for payment, will result in immediate termination of your Account, forfeiture of Winnings, and potentially subject you to civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.9 Bonus Cash. A Cash Player may be granted bonus cash and/or credits (“Bonus Cash”). Bonus Cash can only be used to enter Cash Competitions, and for no other purpose.  When you enter a Cash Competition, US$0.01 of Bonus Cash will be used to enter the competition for every US$0.10 spent on the Cash Competition entry fee. However, if Bonus Cash is the only currency available in your account, additional Bonus Cash will be used to enter Cash Competitions. When you win a Cash Competition, any Bonus Cash that you have used to pay the entry fee will be returned to you and any additional Winnings beyond your entry fee will be paid in U.S. Dollars. If you do not enter a Cash Competition for 90 continuous days, all Bonus Cash in your Account may be forfeited. Moreover, if you haven’t enter a game in the past 150 days, all tickets in your Account may be forfeited. We will also send a reminder mail to players in advance.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.10 Forfeiture of Funds. If your Account is unilaterally closed or terminated because of your Fraud, we may determine that the funds in your Account shall be forfeited and not returned to you.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        6.11 Account Monthly Maintenance Fee. We may charge you of a maintenance fee of US$2.00 per month if your Account is inactive (i.e., you have not entered at least one tournament) for six consecutive months or more (the “Monthly Maintenance Fee”).  You will receive an email (if we have your correct email address) or another form of written message (e.g., an in-Game message) if your Account is inactive for five months or more, notifying you that if your Account remains inactive for one more month, the Monthly Maintenance Fee will be deducted from your Account each consecutive month. If there are no funds in your Account, the Monthly Maintenance Fee will not be deducted from your Account.  However, if your Account has no funds and has been inactive for twelve or more consecutive months, your Account may be closed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">7. Taxes </h2>
    <p class="text">
        It is our policy, and in compliance with United States Internal Revenue Service regulations, to send an IRS Form 1099-MISC or other appropriate forms to any user who wins in excess of US$600 in any given year. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, we may also send you a W-9 and/or additional tax forms. We reserve the right to withhold (from your existing Account balance and/or from future net Winnings) any amount required to be withheld by Applicable Laws. You remain solely responsible for paying all federal and other taxes in accordance with the laws that apply in your local, state, province, and/or country of residence.

    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">15. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </h2>
    <p class="text">
        15.1 General.  This section is an agreement between you and Tapwinner, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this section. This section shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        15.2 Claims Covered by Arbitration.  All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms, any Services, or the relationship between you and Tapwinner (“Disputes”) shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this section are any claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, Tapwinner' or Tapwinner' licensors' copyright, trademark or patent rights; and (ii) brought in small claims court.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        15.3 Informal Negotiations.  You and Tapwinner shall try to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 60 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”). The Notice of Dispute must: (i) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. Tapwinner will send its Notice of Dispute to your email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Tapwinner Customer Support, 28 E. 3rd Avenue, San Mateo, CA 94043 by U.S. mail.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        15.4 Binding Arbitration.  If you and Tapwinner cannot resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, you agree to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        15.5 Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAWS, YOU AND TAPWINNER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, where permitted under the Applicable Laws, unless both you and Tapwinner agree otherwise, the court may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        15.6 Limitation on Time to File Claims. Claims or Disputes you may have arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise, such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.
